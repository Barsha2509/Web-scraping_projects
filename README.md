# Web-scrapping-data-visualiztion
In this project, data about the GDP of different countries in the world was obtained from the worldometer webpage by using BeautifulSoup library and read_html function of the pandas library in python for web scraping. The following data was collected from the webpage: Country (name of the country), GDP, GDP per capita, population and share of the world GDP (how much GDP of each country accounts of the world total GDP). The obtained data was then converted into a dataframe and then saved as a csv file. Then the collected data was loaded into Jupyter notebook, cleaned and analyzed. The summary statistics of the data were obtained, GDP was binned into low, medium and high categories, and visualization techniques were used to get further insight of the data. Lastly, a dashboard was created by using Tableau to give a quick glance of the important keypoints of the data to the viewers.
