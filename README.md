# Web-scrapping-data-visualiztion
In this project, data about the GDP of different countries in the world was obtained from the worldometer webpage by using BeautifulSoup library and read_html function of the pandas library in python for web scraping. The obtained data was then converted into a dataframe and then saved as a csv file. Then the collected data was loaded into Jupyter notebook, cleaned and analyzed (by obtaining summary statistics and visualizing it). Lastly, a dashboard was created by using Tableau to give a quick glance of the important keypoints of the data to the viewers.
