I didn&apos;t specify any spiciness level, but I thought it was just right (mild-medium).  The biryani was flavorful and had a generous amount of mutton.  And chicken tikka was creamy and deliciously spiced with tender chunks of meat.  My only complaint was the naan (a couple of small triangles come with the combo meal) which didn&apos;t taste like it was freshly made. It was lacking any crisp, airy pockets and wasn&apos;t very warm even though it came out several minutes after our entree did. \\n\\nOverall, quite tasty but for the same price, there are several Indian buffets in the area which are also very good and give you more variety and quantity.\"},{\"author\":\"Bharat M.\",\"datePublished\":\"2020-09-06\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":1},\"description\":\"We loved chicken hakka noodles from this restaurant, but yesterday was not a happy experience.

       " 'Excellent biryani plus very strict COVID safety practices among the counter AND kitchen staff make this a place I will happily come back to when I have that need for biryani. \\\\n\\\\nThis is a very clean and airy restaurant, but they do not appear to be open for indoor dining. Most folks I saw coming and going here had ordered online and were carrying out. \\\\n\\\\nOnline ordering is the thing here, and next time I come I&apos;ll do that. This was the next place I came to after my first biryani stop at another restaurant crashed and burned over lack of COVID safety measures. (I reviewed that other restaurant on that.) \\\\n\\\\nHere, however, kitchen staff were masked and all precautions were being taken, including providing hand sanitizer to guests, sanitizing my card, requiring masks and social distancing. I felt like my food was prepared in a COVID-safe environment and that the staff here was not just trained in COVID safety theater, but actually practiced it. \\\\n\\\\nI ordered inside and my order was brought out to my car for me to take home. \\\\n\\\\nAt home I was very pleased with the portion sizes - my order of Chettinadu Boneless Mutton biryani will feed 3 hungry people. The dish is beautiful as a biryani should be, perfectly spiced and generously studded with tender boneless mutton. It&apos;s absolutely delicious! Raita and sauce enhance the experience.\\\\n\\\\nI also ordered the chicken tikka masala for my spice averse family. The chicken tikka is absolutely delicious.\\\\n\\\\nService is fast, professional, and friendly. They do not have touchless payment, but the man who took my card sanitized it before handing it back to me - a nice touch. All staff were wearing masks correctly and they are very conscientious with their COVID precautions in back.\\\\n\\\\n5 delicious food served here with strict COVID safety stars',\n",

       " '3 years later and this location is still TRASH based off customer service alone. The gentleman I had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of speaking to while trying to place my phone order for pick up was dismissive. I did not like that as I&apos;m sure no one would. And for that, this place will continue to receive 1 star. Also, if you plan on paying cash for a pick up order - you won&apos;t be able to order over the phone. You&apos;ll have to place the order when you arrive to the restaurant and wait until your food is ready. I was informed there is a 30 minute wait time (WHICH IS THE EXACT REASON I WAS CALLING AHEAD TO PLACE THE ORDER TO AVOID WAITING) which ultimately helped make the decision to not eat here so much easier. What a joke. Not quite sure how you all are still in business but be thankful your food is good because I know your customer service isn&apos;t what is bringing people back. \\\\n\\\\nI will say, the Ohio location is wonderful. I should have trusted my gut and ordered from there after work instead of calling this location because it&apos;s closer to home. Sometimes convenience ain&apos;t always the best choice. I&apos;ve learned my lesson.',\n",

While trying to navigate, someone finally showed up to the front counter and took my order so I didn&apos;t have to keep messing with that thing. \\\\n\\\\nI then went to sit at the table and waited on a server - who never showed! After waiting 20 minutes, I got a message saying my food was ready for pickup. They had my order bagged up to go on the counter and never bothered to inform me they placed it to go - even after paying tip. When I asked if they are doing dine-in service, they said they are and could get me a plate. Too late! I know when I&apos;m being discriminated against, and I wasn&apos;t made to feel welcome from the time I stepped in the door.

Overall , it was a ok experience. My kids liked it. The lady accepted my yelp 10% . The place and people were good. But the food , it wasn&apos;t as great as I thought it would be.',\n",

And chicken tikka was creamy and deliciously spiced with tender chunks of meat.

      "\n",
      "We will not come back !;)\n",
      "I ordered online and picked up an order of Boneless Chicken Biryani and chicken tikka masala. Both were great!! But, I did find a full sized cherry with a stem in my chicken tikka masala... Is this a normal thing in Indian cuisine? I&apos;ve had A LOT of Indian cuisine from many different places in different states in my lifetime, and I&apos;ve never heard of or had a cherry being added to chicken tikka masala. \n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, I&apos;m 1000% positive it was a cherry. It had a stem, it tasked like a cherry I actually ate most of it because I like cherries just shocked it was in this particular dish\n",
      "One of my Indian co-workers recommended this place and it was better than I expected based on the average 3.5-star rating.  Bawarchi offers a large variety of vegetarian and non-veggie biryanis and curries.  The combo meal allows you to choose one of each.  I ordered the mutton biryani with chicken tikka masala.  I didn&apos;t specify any spiciness level, but I thought it was just right (mild-medium).  The biryani was flavorful and had a generous amount of mutton.  And chicken tikka was creamy and deliciously spiced with tender chunks of meat.  My only complaint was the naan (a couple of small triangles come with the combo meal) which didn&apos;t taste like it was freshly made. It was lacking any crisp, airy pockets and wasn&apos;t very warm even though it came out several minutes after our entree did. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, quite tasty but for the same price, there are several Indian buffets in the area which are also very good and give you more variety and quantity.\n",
      "We loved chicken hakka noodles from this restaurant, but yesterday was not a happy experience. Received hakka noodles which were not properly cooked. Not sure if they changed the chefs.\n",
      "This restaurant is my favorite for Indian cuisine. The chicken Biriyani smells so fragrant and fresh, full of colors too. The chicken can get spicy, but the good kind that makes you want to keep going for another bite. Looks beautiful- tastes beautiful. Will be ordering from them soon.\n",
      "Ordered delivery through DooorDash and it arrived within the time posted. It was really nice to has a break from all the cooking the past few weeks. Mr. G. and I shared a few apps and an entree and were able to get dinner and lunch the next day as well. The veg dumplings were great and the veg korma was my favorite. The mushroom appetizer was also really good with a nice kick to it. We got some roti on the side too and it was still warm when we ate it. Looking forward to going in person....some day!\n",
      "This place was on our way home from Austin so stop by. The place was very clean and nice inside. The waiter greeted us and sat us down. After few minutes took our order. The chicken 65 was good especially with their spicy sauce. Good portion for the price. The tikka masala, chicken was over cooked. The shrimp was too sweet even with medium level. The veggie curry was not cooked enough. You can taste the uncooked veggies. The fried rice and noodle was very tasty. The curry wasn&apos;t was warm enough like the other yelp reviewer said. Overall , it was a ok experience. My kids liked it. The lady accepted my yelp 10% . The place and people were good. But the food , it wasn&apos;t as great as I thought it would be.\n",
      "No one was there at arrival, just one other guy waiting for take out but the guy said the customers&apos; UberEats order would be another 5-7 mins, turned out to be almost 20, and lotsa customers came in after. They must need additional help in the kitchen and front area, as many people waited to even get attention from the one guy with good hair who was running the front area.  Just sharing feedback. Take care!\n",
      "You ask them to use less oil in your order and they put in more. Unhealthy food. Plenty of alternatives. Buyer beware. Go elsewhere.\n"
